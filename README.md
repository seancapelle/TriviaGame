# Star Wars Trivia Game

This app asks 10 Star Wars trivia questions, allowing the user 10 seconds to answer. Incorrect guesses will manipulate the DOM to show a fail message, while correct ones congratulate the user. Each response view gives a "cooldown" of four seconds. 

The most challenging part of this project was working with the timer function.
